- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **3D & Animation**: Three.js, WebGL (Custom GLSL Shaders), GSAP, Anime.js
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for interactive spatial soundscapes
- **Deployment**: Vercel / Google Cloud Run

## 📁 Project Structure

- `/src/components/Portfolio` - The main portfolio sections (Hero, About, Projects, Experience, Contact)
- `/src/components/UI` - Reusable UI components and animation wrappers (TextReveal, ScrollReveal)
- `/src/components/PaperIntro` - The 3D WebGL paper simulation and intro sequence
- `/src/utils` - Helper functions, shaders, and WebGL utilities
